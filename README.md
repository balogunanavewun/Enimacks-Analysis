9. I observe that the Eastern region made more sales of Jam and Preservative products with a total sales of $50,241.00. I also notice the two sales people from the East region are Andrew and Laura.. The total sales for the Eastern region in total revenue is $108,275.50 ranking the second highest for the year 2019. I observe that 3 customers have patronized this region and they are Company D, J and Y. The top customer for this region has been company D purchasing a total goods of $67,180.50 in total revenue.

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. I recommend Company AA be contacted to ascertain the reason for the low patronage and also given a discount to encourage them to buy more. 

2. Nancy performed best for the year. I recommend her sales strategy should be analyzed and management should also introduce training programs for other sales persons that can boost sales in the coming year. Commission for the best sales person could also be introduced to motivate other sales persons.

3. I recommend another sales person be added to the South to assist Anne who is the only sales person in that region. This will increase the human capital in the South for effectiveness.

4. Jan performed least for the year and I do recommend he be sent for training on sales and customer retention.

5. Top Companies like D and H should be targeted for loyalty programs or companies D and H for discounts to encourage them to purchase more in the coming year.

6. The sales trend shows a noticeable low sales in February and April. I recommend launching seasonal sales promotions, discount sales or adjusting the price of products to encourage more sales or measures implemented in December for months with low sales.

7. Finetune and implement sales strategies in the North and convene this to other salespeople in other regions especially in the West.

8. Beverages lead the sales with $110,577.11 making it the highest sales product by category. I recommend that beverages should always be made available in stock or increasing stock levels to maximize profit.
